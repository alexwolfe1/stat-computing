**Breaks:** Four hours of lecture is a long time. We'll take two 10 minute breaks as follows:

* Break 1: 2:15-2:25

* Break 2: 3:40-3:50

Please be on time coming back from breaks - I don't intend to wait for people to continue the lecture. If you are going to be late, please be respectful when you come back to the classroom.
